<h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Ezra Kachi</strong>, a passionate and creative web developer.</p>

        <p>
            I specialize in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that deliver real value. 
            My journey into web development started from a deep love for technology and creativity, and today, 
            I am committed to turning ideas into powerful digital solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            With strong skills in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, 
            I focus on writing clean code and crafting beautiful user experiences. 
            Whether it’s designing a simple landing page or developing a full website, 
            I approach every project with energy, attention to detail, and a drive for excellence.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond coding, I’m a fast learner who constantly seeks to grow, adapt, 
            and stay updated with the latest trends in web development. 
            I believe that great websites are not just built — they are designed to connect, inspire, and perform.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m excited to bring your ideas to life and take on new challenges with passion and professionalism.
